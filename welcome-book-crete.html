            <p class="mb-4">Kos Town pulses with a delightful energy, blending ancient history with modern Mediterranean life. One of its greatest pleasures is the vibrant café culture – the perfect way to start your day, take a midday break, or simply watch the world go by.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-sky-600 mb-3">Kos Town Coffee & Bites (Just Moments Away)</h3>
            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Your Morning Ritual, Elevated:</strong> Forget generic hotel coffee; Kos invites you to embrace the local ritual. Whether it's a strong traditional Greek coffee slowly brewed, a refreshing iced Freddo Espresso or Cappuccino (the modern Greek staples), or a meticulously crafted specialty brew, there's a coffee experience waiting for you.</p>
            <p class="mb-2"><strong>The Vasileos Pavlou Duo:</strong> You are incredibly fortunate! Right on your doorstep at Vasileos Pavlou 33, mere steps from your apartment, you'll find not one, but two distinct and highly-regarded spots, offering different but complementary experiences. This unique proximity means your perfect coffee or brunch is never far away.</p>
            <div class="mb-4 p-4 border border-slate-200 rounded-lg">

                <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 mb-2">Vasileos Pavlou 33</p>
                <p>This is your ideal destination for a relaxed breakfast or brunch. Their menu boasts creative options like overnight oats (try the Cacao Porridge or Peanut Butter Oats), flavourful egg dishes such as traditional Kayianas or spicy Shakshuka, savoury pancakes with bacon and egg, and fresh salads. They serve a range of coffees, including espresso, filter, and cold brew, with plant-based milk alternatives available. The atmosphere is welcoming and friendly, suitable for lingering with a laptop (free Wi-Fi provided) or enjoying the outdoor seating. They even welcome dogs! Open daily from 07:00 to 18:00 (Sundays 08:00 - 16:00). You can find them on Facebook and Instagram. As a point of interest, it's located near the historic Altar of Dionysus.</p>

                <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 mb-2">Vasileos Pavlou 33</p>
                <p>If exceptional coffee is your priority, head next door to "The Cup". This small, non-smoking café is renowned as a proper "third wave" coffee shop, praised for its outstanding espresso drinks brewed without pretension. They offer a variety of plant milks (oat, almond, sprout mentioned) and often have vegan snack bars and cookies available. While primarily focused on coffee, they also serve delicious and affordable ciabatta sandwiches. The service is noted as friendly, and free Wi-Fi is available. Be aware that due to its quality and popularity, you might encounter a wait during peak times, especially if ordering food rather than just takeaway coffee. Opening hours appear extensive: Monday-Friday 07:00-22:00, Saturday-Sunday 08:00-16:00.</p>

It's also a lovely spot for a morning coffee or fresh juice while admiring the historic site.</li>
                <li><strong>Coffee Stories:</strong> A charming neighbourhood café located at Korai 5. Known for its sweet atmosphere, standard Greek coffee offerings (Freddo Espresso, Cappuccino, Frappe, etc.), and delivery options. Open daily 06:00-20:00 (Sundays until 15:00).</li>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-sky-600 mt-8 mb-3">A Taste of Kos - Dining Recommendations</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Kos Town presents a delightful array of dining experiences, from casual seaside tavernas to elegant restaurants.</p>
            <h4 class="text-xl font-medium text-slate-700 mb-2">Seafood by the Water:</h4>
            <p class="mb-3">A quintessential Greek island experience! Head towards the port for <strong>Barbouni</strong> and <strong>Nick the Fisherman</strong>, practically neighbours. Barbouni offers a wonderful shore-side setting (book ahead for a waterside table) and is praised for dishes like cod croquettes, courgette fritters, squid ink tagliatelle, and sushi. Both serve incredibly fresh, simply grilled or prepared fish. <strong>Votsalakia</strong> is another popular seafront option. <strong>Kalymnos Seafood Tavern</strong>, also on the water's edge, is noted for its huge menu, reasonable prices, and friendly service.</p>
            
            <h4 class="text-xl font-medium text-slate-700 mb-2">Authentic Greek & Meze:</h4>
            <p class="mb-3">For a true taste of local cuisine, <strong>Patriko</strong> is a fantastic family-run choice in a side street near Dolphin Square, offering high-quality food, outstanding service, reasonable prices, and a wonderful selection of traditional mezes (small sharing plates) – try the baked feta with honey or the signature Patriko Salad. <strong>Taverna Evdokia Mummy's Cooking</strong> provides a complete Greek experience with genuine hospitality and delicious, fresh dishes prepared by Evdokia herself – the eggplant spread and feta-stuffed peppers come highly recommended. <strong>Elia Tavern</strong>, though perhaps quieter in the shoulder season, boasts fantastic traditional decor and a great menu. <strong>Broadway</strong>, operating since 1990, offers traditional Greek cuisine with a contemporary twist and generous portions – the beef youvetsi (slow-braised beef with orzo-like pasta) is a highlight. In the Town Square, <strong>Aegli</strong> is not just a cafe but an all-women's cooperative supporting local women; stop by for their refreshing homemade lemonade and snacks.</p>

            <h4 class="text-xl font-medium text-slate-700 mb-2">International Flavours:</h4>
            <p class="mb-3">If you fancy a change, <strong>Twin Dragon</strong> on the main beach offers Chinese and Asian cuisine with sea views. For Mexican food and steaks in a themed setting near the port, try <strong>El Paso</strong>.</p>

            <h4 class="text-xl font-medium text-slate-700 mb-2">Elegant & Fine Dining:</h4>
            <p class="mb-3">For a special occasion, <strong>Cuvée</strong> at the Aqua Blu Hotel in Lambi provides sophisticated, modern destination dining with tasting menus. In Kos Town, <strong>Petrino</strong> offers an elegant atmosphere perfect for a romantic meal, while <strong>Platanos Restaurant</strong>, set in its historic location under the plane tree, delivers fine dining quality with beautiful presentation.</p>

            <h4 class="text-xl font-medium text-slate-700 mb-2">Casual & Reliable:</h4>
            <p class="mb-6"><strong>Ali Restaurant</strong> and <strong>Lambros Steakhouse</strong> are recommended local spots, as is <strong>Thrasyvoulos</strong>.</p>

Layers of history are visible everywhere, from Ancient Greek and Roman ruins to medieval castles built by the Knights of St. John, Ottoman mosques, and elegant Italian-era buildings. Many key sites are easily explored on foot from your apartment.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-sky-600 mt-8 mb-3">Village Charm - Beyond the Capital</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Escaping Kos Town reveals traditional villages nestled in the mountains or overlooking the sea, offering a different pace and perspective.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 pl-4 space-y-3">
                <li><strong>Zia:</strong> An absolute must-visit, especially for sunset. This beautiful mountain village, about 16km south of Kos Town, offers breathtaking panoramic views towards Kalymnos, Pserimos, and the Turkish coast, which become truly spectacular as the sun goes down. While popular with tourists, it retains its charm with whitewashed buildings, craft shops, and excellent dining options. <strong>Oromedon</strong> restaurant is highly recommended for its combination of stunning views and delicious local cuisine (try the mountain pork with lemon and fennel, or the traditional moussaka). You can also visit the nearby Kos Natural Park or hike to the summit of Mount Dikeos (Kos's highest peak) from Zia. Given its popularity for sunset, consider booking restaurants or transport in advance; specific sunset bus tours are available.</li>
                <li><strong>Kefalos:</strong> Located 40km southwest of Kos Town, Kefalos offers a quieter, more traditional base compared to the capital. The village sits picturesquely on a hill overlooking Kamari Bay, home to many beautiful beaches (like Agios Stefanos) and the iconic Kastri islet. Explore the narrow alleys and traditional white houses of the upper village, or enjoy the seaside amenities of Kamari below. Kefalos was the island's ancient capital, Astypalea, and historical remnants include the ruins of Kefalos Castle and the nearby Basilica of Saint Stephen. It's an excellent hub for exploring the southern peninsula's beaches and the Aspri Petra cave. Numerous cafes and tavernas cater to visitors, including <strong>Mylotopi</strong> (a cafe in a restored windmill with great views), <strong>Taverna Niotis</strong> (known for its unique no-menu, multi-course Greek experience), <strong>Taverna Cavos</strong> (recommended by locals for fresh fish), and the modern, well-reviewed <strong>Ficus</strong> restaurant.</li>
                <li><strong>Pyli:</strong> A traditional settlement about 15km southwest of Kos Town. Its main draw is the nearby Paleo Pyli (Old Pyli), the atmospheric ruins of a Byzantine fortress perched on a hill offering expansive views. New Pyli village has a central square with traditional cafes and taverns. A simple ouzeri near the fortress offers drinks, meze, and views. <strong>Fox cafe</strong> in Pyli village square is noted for nice cakes, particularly Banoffee pie.</li>
                <li><strong>Antimachia:</strong> Situated 23km southwest of Kos Town, near the airport. This sizeable traditional village is dominated by the imposing Venetian Castle of Antimachia. This large fortress enclosed an entire settlement, and its impressive walls, bastions, and two small churches (Agios Nikolaos and Agia Paraskevi, often open with visible frescoes) are worth exploring. Entry to the castle is free, though check for any access restrictions. The village also hosts the Traditional House of Antimachia, a museum recreating early 20th-century island life, and is known for its honey festival.</li>
                <li><strong>Asfendiou & Mountain Hamlets (Lagoudi, Asomatos):</strong> For a glimpse of authentic, rural Kos away from the main tourist track, explore the villages on the slopes of Mount Dikeos, about 14-15km south of Kos Town. Asfendiou itself is a large village with traditional architecture. Nearby Lagoudi is interesting as a village that was largely abandoned and then rediscovered and refurbished. Asomatos is particularly untouched by tourism. A traditional kafeneion (cafe) in Asomatos is mentioned as a lively spot offering meze, drinks, and occasional live music. <strong>Grandma's House</strong> taverna in Lagoudi is also noted.</li>
                <li><strong>Platani:</strong> Just 3km from Kos Town, Platani is unique as the home of Kos's Turkish-speaking Muslim minority. It offers a different cultural flavour and is known for the Turkish-influenced <strong>Sherif</strong> restaurant, a local favourite.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-sky-600 mt-8 mb-3">Ancient Wonders - The Asklepion</h3>
            <p class="mb-2">No visit to Kos is complete without exploring the <strong>Asklepion</strong>, the island's most significant archaeological site and a place of profound historical importance.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 pl-4 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Significance:</strong> Renowned throughout antiquity, this was one of the most important healing sanctuaries dedicated to Asclepius, the god of medicine and health. It served not only as a place of worship and healing but also as a respected medical school, intrinsically linked to Hippocrates, the Kos-born "Father of Modern Medicine," who is believed to have taught and practiced here. The serene setting on a verdant hillside overlooking the sea and the Turkish coast was considered integral to the therapeutic process.</li>
                <li><strong>Layout:</strong> The sanctuary unfolds across three beautifully landscaped terraces connected by monumental staircases. The <strong>first level</strong> housed treatment rooms, fountains for ritual purification, Roman-era baths, and possibly the medical school itself. The <strong>second level</strong> was focused on worship, featuring the oldest temple ruins (4th C. BC Temple of Asclepius) and the partially restored Temple of Apollo (Asclepius's father). A grand staircase leads to the <strong>third level</strong>, the site of the largest temple dedicated to Asclepius, flanked by porticoes (stoas) likely used for accommodating patients and visitors. Remains of an early Christian church also exist here. Above this level lies a forest dedicated to Apollo, offering magnificent views.</li>
                <li><strong>Visiting:</strong> The Asklepion is conveniently located just 4km from Kos Town. You can reach it easily by rental car, taxi, the local DEAS bus (City Line 3 or 6 from Kos Town, check schedules), or even on foot for the more energetic (approx. 50 mins). Allow at least 1-2 hours to explore the archaeological site thoroughly; add extra time if you plan to visit the adjacent Hippocrates Foundation Museum and Botanical Gardens (separate admission). To fully grasp the site's history and significance, hiring a licensed guide is highly recommended. Due to the heat and potential crowds, visiting early in the morning or later in the afternoon is advisable during peak summer months (July-August). Spring and autumn offer particularly atmospheric conditions. <em>Important Note: Reports suggest the site currently lacks disabled access.</em></li>

            <p class="mb-4">Exploring Kos is part of the adventure! Here’s a rundown of the best ways to get around the island and discover its treasures.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-sky-600 mb-3">Getting Around the Island:</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 pl-4 space-y-3">
                <li><strong>Rental Car / Scooter / ATV:</strong> For maximum freedom and flexibility, especially if you plan to explore beyond Kos Town and visit more remote beaches or villages, renting a vehicle is highly recommended. Numerous rental agencies are located in Kos Town, at the airport, and in major resorts like Tigaki, Marmari, and Kardamena. Expect to pay around €35-€60 per day for a small car and €25 per day for a scooter, though prices vary by season and rental duration. You'll need a valid driving license (an International Driving Permit may be required for non-EU licenses) and potentially a credit card for a deposit. Booking in advance is advisable during the busy summer months (June-September).</li>
                <li><strong>KTEL Intercity Buses:</strong> The public bus service (KTEL) offers an economical way to travel between Kos Town, the airport, and the main villages and resorts. The main bus station is centrally located in Kos Town at 7 Kleopatras Street. Buses are generally modern and air-conditioned. Tickets are purchased directly on the bus, with fares ranging from approximately €2.30 to €5.20 depending on the destination. Timetables are more frequent during the summer season but can be limited, especially on Sundays or for less common routes. Always check the latest schedule online (www.ktel-kos.gr) or at the station. Contact: +30 22420 22292.</li>
                <li><strong>Urban Buses (DEAS):</strong> For travel within Kos Town and to nearby areas like Lambi, Psalidi, Agios Fokas, Platani, the Asklepion, and Therma Beach, use the municipal bus service. Bus stops are located around town, including near the harbour. Check routes and timetables on the Kos Mobility website/app (mobility.kos.gr) or call +30 22420 26276. City Line 5 provides hourly service to Therma Beach between 09:15 and 16:35.</li>
                <li><strong>Taxis:</strong> Readily available throughout the island, especially in Kos Town (taxi rank at Akti Kountouriotou), the airport, and major resorts. Taxis can be hailed, found at ranks, or booked by phone (Kos Town: +30 22420 23333 / 22777) or online (e.g., KosTaxi.eu, KosRadioTaxi.gr). Taxis are metered but it's wise to confirm the approximate fare or agree on a price for longer journeys, like to the airport or distant villages. Expect fares like: Kos Town-Kefalos ~€50-€60; Kos Town-Zia ~€19-€23.</li>
                <li><strong>Cycling:</strong> Kos's relatively flat terrain, particularly along the north and east coasts, makes cycling a pleasant option for shorter distances. Dedicated cycle paths connect Kos Town with Tigaki to the west and Lambi/Psalidi to the east. It's a great way to explore the areas close to Kos Town, including Lambi Beach. Bike rentals are widely available for around €5-€10 per day. Remember sun protection and water!</li>
