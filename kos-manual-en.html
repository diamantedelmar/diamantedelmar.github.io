            <section id="section3" class="card">
                <h2>Section 3: Island Living – Your Insider's Guide to Kos</h2>
                <p>Kos Town pulses with a delightful energy, blending ancient history with modern Mediterranean life. One of its greatest pleasures is the vibrant café culture – the perfect way to start your day, take a midday break, or simply watch the world go by.</p>

                <h3>Kos Town Coffee & Bites (Just Moments Away)</h3>
                <p><strong>Your Morning Ritual, Elevated:</strong> Forget generic hotel coffee; Kos invites you to embrace the local ritual. Whether it's a strong traditional Greek coffee slowly brewed, a refreshing iced Freddo Espresso or Cappuccino (the modern Greek staples), or a meticulously crafted specialty brew, there's a coffee experience waiting for you.</p>
                <p><strong>The Vasileos Pavlou Duo:</strong> You are incredibly fortunate! Right on your doorstep at <strong>Vasileos Pavlou 33</strong>, mere steps from your apartment, you'll find not one, but two distinct and highly-regarded spots, offering different but complementary experiences. This unique proximity means your perfect coffee or brunch is never far away.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Alchimion:</strong> This is your ideal destination for a relaxed <strong>breakfast or brunch</strong>. Their menu boasts creative options like overnight oats (try the Cacao Porridge or Peanut Butter Oats), flavourful egg dishes such as traditional Kayianas or spicy Shakshuka, savoury pancakes with bacon and egg, and fresh salads. They serve a range of coffees, including espresso, filter, and cold brew, with plant-based milk alternatives available. The atmosphere is welcoming and friendly, suitable for lingering with a laptop (free Wi-Fi provided) or enjoying the outdoor seating. They even welcome dogs! Open daily from 07:00 to 18:00 (Sundays 08:00 - 16:00). You can find them on Facebook and Instagram. As a point of interest, it's located near the historic Altar of Dionysus.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Cup:</strong> If <strong>exceptional coffee</strong> is your priority, head next door to "The Cup". This small, non-smoking café is renowned as a proper "third wave" coffee shop, praised for its outstanding espresso drinks brewed without pretension. They offer a variety of plant milks (oat, almond, sprout mentioned) and often have vegan snack bars and cookies available. While primarily focused on coffee, they also serve delicious and affordable ciabatta sandwiches. The service is noted as friendly, and free Wi-Fi is available. Be aware that due to its quality and popularity, you might encounter a wait during peak times, especially if ordering food rather than just takeaway coffee. Opening hours appear extensive: Monday-Friday 07:00-22:00, Saturday-Sunday 08:00-16:00. Address confirmed as Vasileos Pavlou 33.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>More Kos Town Gems:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Zero Cafe Bar:</strong> Venture a short walk towards the harbour to find this haven for craft beer enthusiasts. Zero boasts an impressive collection of Greek craft beers (bottled and draught), with a knowledgeable and friendly owner happy to offer recommendations. Relax in the large, shady beer garden or cozy courtyard. They also host live music and show sports, and serve coffee, cocktails, tasty snacks, and refreshing homemade lemonade. Open long hours.</li>
                    <li><strong>Platanos Restaurant:</strong> For a meal steeped in history and romance, dine beneath the legendary Plane Tree of Hippocrates. Located in Platanos Square, this spot offers a beautiful setting, excellent, high-quality food (veal cheek, Greek salad, and unique flambéed coffee receive praise), attentive service, and often features live music, creating a wonderful ambiance. It's also a lovely spot for a morning coffee or fresh juice while admiring the historic site.</li>
                    <li><strong>Coffee Stories:</strong> A charming neighbourhood café located at Korai 5. Known for its sweet atmosphere, standard Greek coffee offerings (Freddo Espresso, Cappuccino, Frappe, etc.), and delivery options. Open daily 06:00-20:00 (Sundays until 15:00).</li>
                    <li><strong>Kentron Street Cafe:</strong> Situated at Venizelou Eleftheriou 2, this spot claims to have the "best coffee in town". They offer a range of coffees, fresh juices, sandwiches, pastries (like bougatsa and tyropites), club sandwiches, milkshakes, and provide delivery and takeaway services, including brunch options. Open daily, with slightly shorter hours on weekends.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Other Notable Mentions:</strong> For a quick bite, <strong>Toast Special</strong> near Agia Paraskevi church is noted for great toast. <strong>Ariston</strong> and <strong>Tsivrini</strong> are famed for the best bougatsa (custard pie). <strong>Ciao Cafe Bistro</strong> in the Old Town offers traditional drinks like Kanelada and Soumada alongside coffee, salads, and meals. <strong>Scoops Cafe</strong> (two locations) is great for takeaway coffee, granitas, waffles, and ice cream. <strong>Kaseta</strong> is an all-day café bar known for quality coffee, cocktails, and a cozy vibe. For a more upscale hotel bar experience with sea views, consider <strong>H2O</strong> at Kos Aktis Art Hotel. <strong>Sitar Cocktail Bar</strong> near the port offers creative cocktails day and night.</p>

                <h3>A Taste of Kos - Dining Recommendations:</h3>
                <p>Kos Town presents a delightful array of dining experiences, from casual seaside tavernas to elegant restaurants.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Seafood by the Water:</strong> A quintessential Greek island experience! Head towards the port for <strong>Barbouni</strong> and <strong>Nick the Fisherman</strong>, practically neighbours. Barbouni offers a wonderful shore-side setting (book ahead for a waterside table) and is praised for dishes like cod croquettes, courgette fritters, squid ink tagliatelle, and sushi. Both serve incredibly fresh, simply grilled or prepared fish. <strong>Votsalakia</strong> is another popular seafront option. <strong>Kalymnos Seafood Tavern</strong>, also on the water's edge, is noted for its huge menu, reasonable prices, and friendly service.</li>
                    <li><strong>Authentic Greek & Meze:</strong> For a true taste of local cuisine, <strong>Patriko</strong> is a fantastic family-run choice in a side street near Dolphin Square, offering high-quality food, outstanding service, reasonable prices, and a wonderful selection of traditional mezes (small sharing plates) – try the baked feta with honey or the signature Patriko Salad. <strong>Taverna Evdokia Mummy's Cooking</strong> provides a complete Greek experience with genuine hospitality and delicious, fresh dishes prepared by Evdokia herself – the eggplant spread and feta-stuffed peppers come highly recommended. <strong>Elia Tavern</strong>, though perhaps quieter in the shoulder season, boasts fantastic traditional decor and a great menu. <strong>Broadway</strong>, operating since 1990, offers traditional Greek cuisine with a contemporary twist and generous portions – the beef youvetsi (slow-braised beef with orzo-like pasta) is a highlight. In the Town Square, <strong>Aegli</strong> is not just a cafe but an all-women's cooperative supporting local women; stop by for their refreshing homemade lemonade and snacks.</li>
                    <li><strong>International Flavours:</strong> If you fancy a change, <strong>Twin Dragon</strong> on the main beach offers Chinese and Asian cuisine with sea views. For Mexican food and steaks in a themed setting near the port, try <strong>El Paso</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Elegant & Fine Dining:</strong> For a special occasion, <strong>Cuvée</strong> at the Aqua Blu Hotel in Lambi provides sophisticated, modern destination dining with tasting menus. In Kos Town, <strong>Petrino</strong> offers an elegant atmosphere perfect for a romantic meal, while <strong>Platanos Restaurant</strong>, set in its historic location under the plane tree, delivers fine dining quality with beautiful presentation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Casual & Reliable:</strong> <strong>Ali Restaurant</strong> and <strong>Lambros Steakhouse</strong> are recommended local spots, as is <strong>Thrasyvoulos</strong>.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Recommendation from the host</h3>
                <h4>A Cut Above the Rest: Why Xasapaki is a Must-Visit in Kos</h4>
                <p>For an unforgettable dining experience that marries the tradition of a classic butcher shop with the flair of a top-tier steakhouse, look no further than Xasapaki (also known as Chasapaki or The Hasapaki) in Kos. This establishment isn't just a place to eat; it's a celebration of quality meat, expertly prepared and served with genuine Greek hospitality.</p>
                <p>Steeped in a rich history that began as a local butcher shop, Xasapaki has evolved into a beloved culinary destination renowned for its unique concept: diners handpick their preferred cuts of meat directly from the butcher's display. Whether you crave a succulent Black Angus steak, a tender local lamb chop, or perhaps even a luxurious Wagyu selection, the choice is yours.

                <h3>Stepping Back in Time (Kos Town History):</h3>
                <p>Kos Town is often described as an "open-air museum," and for good reason. Layers of history are visible everywhere, from Ancient Greek and Roman ruins to medieval castles built by the Knights of St. John, Ottoman mosques, and elegant Italian-era buildings. Many key sites are easily explored on foot from your apartment.</p>

                <h3>Village Charm - Beyond the Capital</h3>
                <p>Escaping Kos Town reveals traditional villages nestled in the mountains or overlooking the sea, offering a different pace and perspective.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Zia:</strong> An absolute must-visit, especially for sunset. This beautiful mountain village, about 16km south of Kos Town, offers breathtaking panoramic views towards Kalymnos, Pserimos, and the Turkish coast, which become truly spectacular as the sun goes down. While popular with tourists, it retains its charm with whitewashed buildings, craft shops, and excellent dining options. <strong>Oromedon</strong> restaurant is highly recommended for its combination of stunning views and delicious local cuisine. You can also visit the nearby <strong>Kos Natural Park</strong> or hike to the summit of <strong>Mount Dikeos</strong> (Kos's highest peak) from Zia. Given its popularity for sunset, consider booking restaurants or transport in advance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Kefalos:</strong> Located 40km southwest of Kos Town, Kefalos offers a quieter, more traditional base. The village sits picturesquely on a hill overlooking Kamari Bay, home to many beautiful beaches (like Agios Stefanos) and the iconic <strong>Kastri islet</strong>. Explore the narrow alleys and traditional white houses of the upper village, or enjoy the seaside amenities of Kamari below. Historical remnants include the ruins of <strong>Kefalos Castle</strong> and the nearby <strong>Basilica of Saint Stephen</strong>. Numerous cafes and tavernas cater to visitors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pyli:</strong> A traditional settlement about 15km southwest of Kos Town. Its main draw is the nearby <strong>Paleo Pyli (Old Pyli)</strong>, the atmospheric ruins of a Byzantine fortress. New Pyli village has a central square with traditional cafes and taverns.</li>
                    <li><strong>Antimachia:</strong> Situated 23km southwest of Kos Town, near the airport. This village is dominated by the imposing <strong>Venetian Castle of Antimachia</strong>. The village also hosts the <strong>Traditional House of Antimachia</strong> and is known for its honey festival.</li>
                    <li><strong>Asfendiou & Mountain Hamlets (Lagoudi, Asomatos):</strong> For a glimpse of authentic, rural Kos, explore these villages on the slopes of Mount Dikeos. Asfendiou has traditional architecture. Nearby <strong>Lagoudi</strong> was largely abandoned and then refurbished. <strong>Asomatos</strong> is particularly untouched by tourism.</li>
                    <li><strong>Platani:</strong> Just 3km from Kos Town, Platani is unique as the home of Kos's Turkish-speaking Muslim minority. It offers a different cultural flavour and is known for the Turkish-influenced <strong>Sherif</strong> restaurant.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Ancient Wonders - The Asklepion:</h3>
                <p>No visit to Kos is complete without exploring the <strong>Asklepion</strong>, the island's most significant archaeological site.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Significance:</strong> Renowned healing sanctuary dedicated to Asclepius, god of medicine. Linked to Hippocrates, "Father of Modern Medicine."</li>
                    <li><strong>Layout:</strong> Three terraces connected by staircases. First level: treatment rooms, baths. Second level: temples. Third level: largest temple, porticoes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visiting:</strong> 4km from Kos Town. Reachable by car, taxi, bus (City Line 3 or 6), or foot. Allow 1-2 hours. Consider a guide. Visit early/late in summer. Spring/autumn ideal. Reports suggest no disabled access.</li>
